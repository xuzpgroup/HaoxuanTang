# Dataset APIs

## Adding data entries

New data entries can be added to the database by the `add_entry.py` script.

## Calculating rating score of datasets

The script `cal_rate_score.py` calculates rating scores for datasets based on the completeness of their data entries. Weights can be defined to adjust the influence of data entries.
